About / extras / getweb

This file is created by compiling foo2js. If you are using an already compiled version, 
from the official Debian repositories (for example), you can overwrite this file (/ usr / sbin / getweb)
to replace the original paths, which are not working today, at least temporarily . 

I advise keeping a backup copy of your original getweb.
